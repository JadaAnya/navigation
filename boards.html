    <p>
       Hi there, I'm Jada McClendon. 
       I am a ungraduate student at UAT.
       I am planning to major in Robotic and Embedded Systems and graduate with the class of 2027.
       I have been a robotics engineer since I was in the sixth grade in 2016, and I hope to continue my career path as a robotics engineer in the future.
       I also hope to work for a big company such as NASA or Tesla to help bring my ideas to the table to help further technology advancement in the future!
