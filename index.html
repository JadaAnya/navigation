    <p>
        My favorite TV series is Steven Universe. 
        I have been a Steven Universe fan since it aired back in May of 2013. 
        Steven Universe is a cartoon that has 4 big characters throughout the show. 
        First you have the main character Steven, and then you have the submain characters consisting of Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl(The Gems).
        The 4 main characters are a team/family that go by "The Crystal Gems".

        <h2>Steven Quartz Universe</h2>
        <p>
            Steven is the son of Greg Universe and Rose Quartz.
            This makes Steven a hybrid between human and gem.
            Steven was also the first and only known gem/human hybrid to exist, and because of this, most gems singled him out saw him as a disgrace to the gem race/culture. 
            The only gems who treated him as their own, were his mother's rebellion group, the Crystal Gems.
            The main reason he was associated with the Crystal Gems was because his mother had to give up her physical form to birth/create Steven himself.
            So her gem embedded itself into Steven's body in the same spot as Rose.
            This gave Steven the powers of Rose herself like her Sheild and healing powers, but because he is a hybrid with a human, he still ages and can be hurt.
